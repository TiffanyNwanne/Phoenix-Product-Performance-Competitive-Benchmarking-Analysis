# Phoenix Product Performance & Competitive Benchmarking Report

**Project Title:** Phoenix Product Performance & Competitive Benchmarking

**Analyst:** Tiffany Nwanne 

**Date:** April 2025

## Project Background

Product Phoenix, a gaming console line , is under evaluation for potential discontinuation due to perceived underperformance. Stakeholders have raised concerns that its challenges stem from either inherent product weaknesses or the competitor‚Äôs dominance Product Helix. To assess this, a five-year data analysis was conducted covering sales performance, marketing investment, customer engagement, and competitor benchmarks.

This project involves cross-functional collaboration between:

- Product Owner & Project Manager: Decision-makers
- Data Analyst (Tiffany Nwanne): Analysis, insights and recommendations
- Database Admin & Data Engineer: Data infrastructure, pipeline and warehousing

## **Executive Summary**

Over the last five years (2020‚Äì2024), Phoenix has demonstrated moderate growth in sales and revenue, peaking in 2023 before a noticeable decline in 2024. Key findings include:

- Phoenix sales increased from 4.8M in 2020 to 7.1M in 2023 but dropped to 5.9M in 2024.
- The competitor consistently outsold Phoenix by 25‚Äì35%, reaching 9.1M units in 2023.
- Phoenix‚Äôs marketing spend was 20‚Äì40% lower than the competitor annually.
- Despite lower sales, Phoenix maintained a strong subscription rate (57%) and online retention (72%), suggesting loyal user base potential.
- The competitor leads in metrics such as units sold and marketing reach. However, Phoenix shows engagement strength, which could be a pivot point if leveraged with better product positioning or exclusive content.

## Analysis

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate Product Phoenix‚Äôs performance over a five-year period across key metrics including sales, revenue, marketing, and user engagement. This evaluation is compared directly with a competing product to inform the decision on whether to discontinue or reposition Phoenix.

**Data Sources**

- Internal Sales & Marketing Data: Units sold, revenue, marketing spend, engagement metrics (Phoenix).
- Competitor Data: Equivalent KPIs for benchmark comparison.
- Period Covered: 2020 ‚Äì 2024
- Granularity: Quarterly and regional breakdown (NA, EU, APAC)

**Tools & Environment**

- Database Engine: MySQL
- Visualization: Tableau (for post-analysis dashboarding)
- Languages Used: SQL (MySQL dialect)

Here‚Äôs the full breakdown of the analysis methodology 

## Insights

The competitor has led consistently in sales since 2020 - 2024.

It still leads strong in all regions (APAC, EMEA & NA).

The competitor spends more on marketing but,  does that mean that we have to spend more on marketing to make more sales? 

Let‚Äôs see if the amount we spend on marketing actually works in our favour.

The analysis shows that :

- It costs ‚âà$0.726 to reach one person and  we have a **1.14% conversion** from reach to sales, which is within industry standards (1% - 2.5%) and considering the product is high ticket and the the competition is strong is a good amount.

Now for Phoenix‚Äôs strengths:

- A user base of nearly 9 million active monthly users.
- An engagement of 14 hours per user per month is solid. This means users are getting value and spending time.
- A high subscription Rate with over half of users subscribing, suggesting monetization and brand loyalty are already working.
- A retention rate of 72% retention is high, indicating satisfied, recurring users.

Having discussed popularity and market dominance through advertising, let‚Äôs see if **Phoenix** has some internal issues by comparing the specs. Here are my insights:

###  Performance

- **Product Phoenix** has higher CPU (3.8 GHz vs 3.5 GHz) and GPU power (12 TFLOPs vs 10.28 TFLOPs).
- Both support up to **8K resolution** and **120 FPS** frame rates.
- **Phoenix** includes more storage (1 TB vs 825 GB).

### Backward Compatibility

- **Phoenix** supports more legacy games and older consoles.

### Gaming Experience

- **Helix** shines with **exclusive game titles** and better **controller innovation** (adaptive triggers, haptics).
- **Phoenix** offers stronger value in **subscription services** (e.g., Game Pass).

### User Experience

- **Helix** is favored for **immersive gameplay and design**.
- **Phoenix** emphasizes **ecosystem flexibility and raw power**.

### Average Scores

- üïπÔ∏è **Product Helix**: **99.98**
- ‚ö° **Product Phoenix**: **117.78**

## Bottom Line

- Some users usually choose **Helix** for a **premium gaming experience** with top-tier exclusives.
- Others choose **Phoenix** for **better performance, value, and content flexibility**.

## Recommendation

Phoenix has a **strong foundation and t**his makes a **budget reallocation strategy** viable. Rather than acquire more new users, I suggest we c**arve out a portion** (e.g., 10‚Äì20%) of marketing budget for:

- Creator partnerships
- Community events
- Social content & forums
- In-game culture, lore, or ecosystem

**This would be tested  in high-retention** regions like EMEA and regions with best subscription rates like APAC.

## **Questions & Answers (Clarifications)**

Q1: Is Phoenix underperforming solely due to weak internal performance?

A: Not entirely. While Phoenix lags in some internal areas (marketing spend, content variety), competitor dominance and stronger branding play a significant role. The product is not fundamentally failing but needs strategic repositioning.

Q2: Does marketing spend need to be increased for Phoenix to compete?

A: Not at all. Data shows that conversion rates are nearly identical despite the competitor‚Äôs large marketing budget.

Q3: Is customer engagement a strength or weakness?

A: A relative strength. Phoenix has retained a loyal base with above-average subscription rates and playtime. However, this strength is being underutilized due to poor visibility and lack of exclusive content.

Q4: Should Phoenix be discontinued?

A: Based on data, discontinuation would be premature. Strategic marketing and loyalty packages to pre-existing users, partnerships, and feature differentiation could revitalize growth. The product has underlying strengths that justify reevaluation rather than exit.
